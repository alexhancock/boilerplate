# boilerplate

A web boilerplate with things I like for building POC web apps.

This is nice to use for things that do not warrant a more complete architecture. It is bare bones by design.

Includes...

* Basic webpack configuration
* Babel with `es2015` and `react` presets
* An express server
* React (with simple server rendering)
* An eslintrc

(I may add a small wrapper around the `Fetch` API)

To take advantage of the linting, run...

```
npm install -g eslint babel-eslint
```

And configure your editor of choice by following the instructions [here](http://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/integrations#editors).

While others are welcome to use this project if they find utility in it, I mainly have it online so that I can clone it whenever I want to build a small POC web app.

I don't not anticipate updating it frequently, or adding new features often.
